          <h2>Products</h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A variety of manures that assure 30% quicker growth over regular manures, while also being 20% to 40% the cost. The products pay for themselves many times over as at least 1 additional harvest is made possible in most climates, and an
            additional 2 in many. This means that even 4-harvest farmers of 40 acres will make roughly an additional $45,000 per year revenue with a 5th harvest.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The next product is called the Falkner’s Field Protein Tester. It has protein percentage readings, GPS readings, and records time and date, as well. This product is intended for professional farmers with 150+ acres of grain. It
            measures a few ounces of grain at each use and costs $3,750.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Next in our product line is the Jerry’s Field Protein Tester. This is a larger industrial protein meter for use at the silo. Features of this product include a trailer accessory, tank, tankless fluid heater, a testing station with
            tamper-proofing. This is our regional-scale protein meter measuring 4 barrels of grain or legume at a time and costs $3,500,000. The additional accessory of a testing trailer at $1,200,000.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cindy’s Field Testing Perishables for the compound mix used to infer protein content in the farmers’ product. We expect it to cost about $0.50 per 2 ounces.</p>
